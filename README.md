# Obsidian Snippets

Just some simple CSS snippets for customising the appearance of Obsidian.

## callout-restore-all

Obsidian 1.0 changed callouts in three ways:

1. Left-hand border removed
2. Grey callout body took the same colour as its header
3. Header text no longer black

This snippet restores the whole old appearance.
