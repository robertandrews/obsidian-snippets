/*

Make collapse arrows always visible.

In Obsidian, elements like headers and bullet list items can fold to collapse.
Default behaviour is to only show the collapse arrow on hover.
This has two negative consequences:
1. Difficult to use on mobile.
2. Reduced inclination to collapse.

This CSS makes the arrows permanently visible.

- Live Preview & Source modes:     .collapse-indicator
- Reading Mode:                    .collapse-icon
